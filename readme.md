# myhELO Coding Assessment

## Introduction

Hi! Welcome to the myhELO Coding Assessment. This is a short, open-ended project that asks you to come up with a neat visualization using data from the FDA API.

## Instructions

1. Download this project to your local PC.
2. Open index.html. You should see a page with a title and some JSON.
3. Open visualization.js, choose an API call from the examples (or come up with your own), then update the decorate_data() function. Depending on what you choose to do, you may need to add or change code in other places.

The only requirement is that you MAY NOT use a library and just dump the data in a chart. It's fine if you want to use a library and show some charts (anyone can do that), but you'll need to demonstrate something in addition. Be creative!

Here are a few directions you could take things:
- Make the application stand out by using some beautiful CSS styles
- Go full mobile and focus on responsiveness across devices
- Perform some advanced analysis using results from multiple API calls
- Add some level of interactivity
- Write your own basic chart library
- Turn the results into some sort of visual game or text adventure

The code is yours to change however you like. Just remember, have fun and show off your strengths and interests! Remember, you are working in an existing codebase, so stick to the same coding styles and conventions.

## Wrapping up

When you're done, simply zip up your project and email it to jziebell@myhelo.com.
